We use pre-order traversal mainly because it follows a 'top-down' logic, 
which is perfect for copying or cloning a tree. Since we visit the root 
node first before looking at its children, we can create the parent node 
and then easily attach its branches. It is also very helpful for showing 
the structure of a document or a folder system. For example, when you look
 at a book’s table of contents, you see the chapter title first and then 
the sub-sections; this is exactly how pre-order works. In short, we use it 
whenever the 'leader' or the 'parent' information is the most important 
part to start with.
